#**Sales data of a credit card company**#
**PowerBI Project**

The notebook jumps in detail onto the sales data of a credit-card-selling company. The project has mainly two dashboards. One to detect customer trends(Customer Dashboard). Another to detect company trends (Transaction Dashboards)

The Dashboards filter, accordingly when a filter is chosen.

The content is taken from a youtube tutorial, that goes deep into data analysis with powerBI.
***I did not follow the tutorial word for word. I added my own twists***
This project was a great opportunity for me to learn and apply data visualization skills to a real project.


**I have learned and used**

1. Dax Query
2. Use of Filters and Slicers
3. Different Charts
4. New Columns and measures
5. Eye Pleasing Dashboard Building
6. Filters Used:


**Week-based reporting**
1. Income level (Low, Med, High)
2. Different Cards (Blue, Platinum, Gold)
3. Different Quarters of year
4. Gender

Here the income groups were created based on Dax Queries. TreeMaps were used to help create Filters.
