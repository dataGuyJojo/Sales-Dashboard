#**Sales data of a credit card company**
**PowerBI Project**

The notebook jumps in details onto the saleds data of a credit-card-selling company. The project has mainly two dashboards. One to detect customer trends(Customer Dashboard). Another to detect company trends (Transaction Dashboards)

The Dashboards filters, accordingly when a filter is choosen.

The content is taken from a youtube tutorial, that goes deep into data analysis with powerBI.
***I did not follow the tutorial word to word. I added my own twists***
This project was a great oppurtunity for me to learn and apply data visualization skills onto a real project.


**I have learnt and used**

*Dax Query
*Use of Filters and Slicers
*Different Charts
*New Columns and measures
*Eye Pleasing Dashboard Building
*Filters Used:


**Week based reporting**
*Income level (Low, Med, High)
*Different Cards (Blue, Platinum, Gold)
*Different Quarters of year
*Gender
Here the income groups were created based on Dax Queries. TreeMaps were used to help create Filters.
